Automation with Python (CLI App / Web App)

## Challenge
- Writing one automation program everyday
- Periodically converting these programs into either Web apps or CLI apps
- At the end of 2025, will develop a master automation app with maximum of these programs

## Automation Programs
- [1] [Days Counter](algorithms/days_counter.py) - Calculate days between two dates (Optionally use today's date)
- [2] [Age Calculator](algorithms/age_calculator.py) - Calculate age in years, months and days from birthdate to today
- [3] [BMI Calculator](algorithms/bmi_calculator.py) - Calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) from weight and height
- [4] [Interest Calculator](algorithms/interest_calculator.py) - Calculate Simple and Compound Interest with yearly breakdown
- [5] [EMI Calculator](algorithms/emi_calculator.py) - Calculate EMI and Amortization Schedule for Reducing Balance and Flat Rate loans. Also compare both types.
- [6] [Bill Splitter](algorithms/bill_splitter.py) - Split a bill among friends based on individual contributions and expenses with minimal transactions and detailed summary report
- [7] [QR Code Generator](algorithms/qr_code_generator.py) - Generate QR code from text or URL and save as image file
- [8] [Barcode Generator](algorithms/barcode_generator.py) - Generate Barcode from text or URL and save as image file
